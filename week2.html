        <p class="description">
            For this weeks codebook, I chose to do a critical data inventory of my top 10 most streamed artists on Spotify, the genre of my most streamed song by them, 
            and the name of that song.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the Steps from the exercise, here were my thoughts:
        </p>
        <p>Obvious findings:</p>
            <ol>Lots of rap and trap/hip-hop artists</ol>
            <ol>For the most part, all of the people I typically listen to</ol>
            <ol>Top 10 songs is full of 2 recent albums that I’ve been repeating so not surprised there</ol>
        <p>Surprising findings:</p>
                <ol>Glokk40Spaz is an artist that I somewhat rarely listen to so it was a bit surprising to see them in the top 10</ol>
                <ol>The amount of metal in my top 10 genres was surprising</ol>
        <p>Value:</p>
                <ol>4 weeks is long enough to show obsession phases (which is pretty evident with the top 10 songs lol), but doesn’t necessarily reflect my long-term taste</ol>

            Early iterations of the data visualization. I just chose the colours without a pallete in mind,<br>
            and wanted a proof of concept before refining the design.
            <br>
            <br>
            The right image is a sloppy version of the final design, but I wanted to see how it would look without<br>
             the actual data and information.

                This is a more refined version of the design, with some minor layout differences and different colours.
