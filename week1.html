        <p class="description">
            For this weeks codebook, I immeditately thought of the Ikea manuals, and OCAD's print instructions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="description sub-head">ðŸš§ User Instructions: ðŸš§</h2>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of user instructions that I found <i>(some that I actually use(d) myself!)</i>:
        </p>
        <p>OCAD saddle stitch & print instructions:</p>
            <ol>This is a fairly detailed set of instructions for setting up an InDesign doc for print <i>(specifically for turning into a saddle stitch booklet)</i>.</ol>
            <ol>I love the little numbered pages it helps visualize the layout of the document, and has saved me multiple times lol.</ol>
            <ol>Straightforward, clean, simple, addresses what settings you need and has pretty throrough notes to prevent you from messing up.</ol>

        </div>
        
        <p>Google Home / Google Nest setup instructions:</p>
            <ol>A boring but to-the-point setup guide for configuring the Google Nest & Home <i>(i have the home from when spotify gave it away for free :3)</i>.</ol>
            <ol>It assumes that the user has an Android for some reason (?) not sure why.</ol>
            <ol>The one thing I will commend is their use of the actual UI buttons you'd see in the app being in the instructions for clarity.</ol>

        </div>
        
        <p>Ikea shelf disassembly guide <i>(very obvious choice but atleast I chose disassembly over assembly)</i>:</p>
            <ol>It blends whimsy with practicality as you can clearly tell what's happening, what you need, and how to do it <i>(all while being fairly minimal)</i>.</ol> 
            <ol>Great and fun use of visuals</ol>

        <h2 class="description sub-head">ðŸš§ User Error: ðŸš§</h2>
        <p>
            For user error, I thought it'd be funny to flip the whole idea of giving the google home products permission to things like the microphone, wifi, etc. Whenever the user gets requested for permission to do something, they can do a paranoid response and go full tinfoil hat mode</i>:
        </p>
        <p>Google Home VS. Paranoid dude, who wins?</p>
            <ol>When the app requests to connect to bluetooth, put the device in the microwave.</ol>
            <ol>When the app requests to connect to wifi, wrap it in tinfoil.</ol>
            <ol>When the app requests to use microphone, proceed to only communicate through pen and paper when in the same room as the device.</ol>

        <h2 class="description sub-head">ðŸš§ User Surveillance: ðŸš§</h2>
        <p>
            When coming up with the idea for user error & surveillance, I thought it would be funny to imagine that the paranoid dude from earlier is actually a secret stalker who has been using the google home device to spy on his crush the whole time. This is part of the reason for his paranoia as he constantly thinks that someone could do the same to him:
        </p>
        <p>Paranoid dude is secretly a stalker lover boy this whole time !?!?! <i>(the plot thickens)</i></p>
